Approach: 
I used FileReader/Writer to read data from file and write into output. BufferedReader/Writer was also used to process the strings of data.

The methodology i used was checking key:value pairs in input file and store them in string variables. Even if single Key:Value pair was absent a blank output file was generated. All blank spaces in key:value pairs were trimmed

After reading through all key value pairs in input file, we parsed through template file and replaced appropriate values into placeholders using string methods.

The template, input and output file were passed as arguments during compile time.



Issues:
Since files were passed as arguments during compile time, the test.sh file was reading input through STDIN and giving me arrayindexOutofBoound error. I replaced ./run.sh template < "input/$f" > "output/$f" with  ./run.sh template "input/$f" "output/$f" in order to get test results.
